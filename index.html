          <li>User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of our machines and software
            interface such as the interface of your computer, printer, phones, etc. </li>
          <li>It helps the user interact with the system in order to increase the user experience and enhance
            efficiency.</li>

          <li>Good user interface never draws useless attention and always finish the tasks first. A good format can
            help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function
            in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a
            stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.</li>

          <li>Interface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though
            most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design
            goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best
            efforts out of themselves.</li>

          <li>At the most basic level, the user interface (UI) is the series of screens, pages, and visual elements—like
            buttons and icons—that enable a person to interact with a product or service. </li>
          <li>Simply put, User Interface Design is important because it can make or break your customer base. It creates
            fewer problems, increases user involvement, perfects functionality and creates a strong link between your
            customers and your website.</li>
          <li>For example, everyday UI uses a combination of tactile input (keyboard and mouse) and a visual and
            auditory output (monitor and speakers). Other types of user interfaces can include: Form-based user
            interface: Used to enter data into a program or application by offering a limited selection of choices.</li>
          <li>A mobile user interface (mobile UI) is the graphical and usually touch-sensitive display on a mobile
            device, such as a smartphone or tablet , that allows the user to interact with the device's apps , features,
            content and functions.</li>
          <li>In manufacturing and design, a mockup, or mock-up, is a scale or full-size model of a design or device,
            used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a prototype
            if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.</li>

        <header>Principles Of User Design</header>
        <article>
          <h1></h1>
          <li>The principles of user interface design are intended to improve the quality of user interface design. <br>
            According to Lucy Lockwood's approach of usage-centered design, these principles are:</li>

          <li>The structure principle: Design should organize the user interface purposefully, in meaningful and <br>
            useful ways based on clear, consistent models that are apparent and recognizable to users, putting related
            things<br>
            together and separating unrelated things, differentiating dissimilar things and making similar things
            resemble one another. <br>
            structure principle is concerned with overall user interface architecture.
          <li>The simplicity principle: The design should make simple, common tasks easy, communicating clearly and
            simply in the user's own language, and providing good shortcuts that are meaningfully related to longer
            procedures.</li>
          <li>The visibility principle: The design should make all needed options and materials for a given task visible
            without distracting the user with extraneous or redundant information. </li> designs don't overwhelm users
          with alternatives or confuse with unneeded information.
          <li>The feedback principle: The design should keep users informed of actions or interpretations, changes of
            state or condition, and errors or exceptions that are relevant <br>
            and of interest to the user through clear, concise, and unambiguous language familiar to users.</li>
          <li>The tolerance principle: The design should be flexible and tolerant, <br>
            reducing the cost of mistakes and misuse by allowing undoing and redoing, <br>
            while also preventing errors wherever possible by tolerating varied inputs and sequences and by interpreting
            all reasonable actions reasonable</li>
          <li>The reuse principle: The design should reuse internal and external components and behaviors, maintaining
            consistency with purpose rather than merely arbitrary consistency, <br>
            thus reducing the need for users to rethink and remember.</li>
          <li>A wireframe is often described as the skeleton of the eventual user interface. It's a low fidelity sketch
            (sometimes literally a pen <br>
            and paper sketch) of the UI. Wireframes convey main features, functions and content of a user interface,
            without getting into the visual design.</li>

        <article>
          <h1>5 innovative examples of user interface design</h1>
          <dt>iOS</dt>
          <p>Apple may have come under fire recently, for things like the debacle over Maps, and the continuing debate
            over its use of skeumorphism. </p>
          <p>But sometimes it's good to stand back and look at the big picture: how Apple revolutionised the computer
            interface in a way that has influenced and shaped everything that's come about since.</p>
          <p>The company pioneered the use of the GUI (graphical user interface) with the introduction of the Lisa
            computer in 1983 and later made it mainstream with the release of the Macintosh in 1984. Then, when it
            introduced the iPhone in 2009, it brought a unique and user-friendly experience to the mobile phone market.

          <p>For years, mobile phone users had been managing with just scroll wheels or arrow buttons to navigate
            through their phones. The iPhone’s touch interface and application icons changed the game because it worked
            and it was easy to use.</p>
          <p> Little has changed regarding the core functionality of the iOS platform since 2009, playing to the old
            saying: "If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it". </p>
          <p>Meanwhile Apple has continued to expand its product offerings, adapting iOS to the iPad and iTouch.
          </p>
          <dt>Windows 8 Mobile</dt>
          <p>Microsoft has been playing catch-up in the smartphone market since Apple and Google took centre stage a few
            years ago. In 2012 Microsoft introduced their latest mobile phone operating system, Windows 8, along with a
            similar desktop version. Windows 8 for mobile features the use of live interactive tiles. This means that
            when you look at your phone's home screen you see multiple application 'tiles' that are constantly updating
            you with information.</p>
          <p>See your latest tweets or text messages with just a glance and all in one spot. Not to mention that the
            arrangement and importance of the tiles are completely customizable.</p>
          <p>The overall look is distinctively different from iOS , which focuses on the use of static icons to navigate
            and pop-up like notifications to catch incoming data. </p>
          </p>The Window’s 8 mobile interface stands out from the crowd because of its rethinking of how we view of now
          almost-constant stream of data.</p>
          <dt>The Nest Thermostat</dt>
          <p>Often, you don't even realize how bad the user experience of a traditional product is until someone comes
            along and improved on it. </p>Case in point, the household thermostat.</p>
          <p>The movement into the digital edge has not done much to improve your home's thermostat. In fact, new
            digital thermostats tend to be much more difficult to program, with their confusing multiple menu systems
            and complicated displays. So, the designers of the Nest thermostat has simplified the process for you.</p>
          <p>Turn it up when you want it hotter and turn it down when you want it colder. The thermostat does the rest
            by learning every time you make an adjustment and building a heating and cooling schedule based on your
            changes. You can even control it from your Smartphone via Wi-Fi.</p>

          <dt> Nintendo’s History of Mario Kart</dt>
          <p>One of the big trends in website design at the moment is the use of parallax scrolling. Essentially this
            means that by using your mouse’s scroll wheel you can advance through a website in such a way that the site
            appears to be three dimensional.</p>
          <p>This 3D effect is created by using some fancy HTML5 and CSS3 coding that makes the websites background move
            at a slower rate then objects set in the foreground.</p>
          <p>This creates a unique user interface that is visually more interesting than the traditional, flat
            two-dimensional up and down scrolling found on most websites. </p>
          <p>The site is a great example of parallax scrolling and how it creates a unique user experience.</p>

          <dt> World Wildlife Fund’s iPad App</dt>
          <p>Consumer products and websites aren't the only places you will see advances in user interface design. iPad
            app developers are continually experimenting with new ways to allow users to interact with their iPad beyond
            just swiping their finger to change a page.</p>
          <p>The World Wildlife Fund has released a free new iPad app called WWF Together that is a stunning example of
            what you can do with gesture-based interactions.</p>
          <p>You can use your finger to move icebergs or erase an image to reveal important information about the
            world’s wildlife. </p>
          <p>All of this wrapped up in an elegantly simple interface that is easy to follow and informational.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="8 UI design trends for 2020">
        <header>8 UI design trends for 2020</header>
        <article>
          <h1></h1>
          <p>The rapid growth of technology influences design trends every year. As designers we need be aware of the
            existing and upcoming design trends, constantly learning, improving and expanding our design toolkit in
            order to be up to date on the current market. Based on my research, experience and observations I’ve
            selected very carefully 8 UI/UX design trends that you should watch in 2020. Let’s get started then! :)</p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Animated Illustrations</dt>
            <dl>Illustrations have been in digital product design for a long time. Their evolution in the last years is
              very impressive. Illustrations as very popular design elements add natural feel and “human touch” to
              overall UX of our products. Illustrations are also very strong attention grabbers: at the top of that by
              applying motion to these illustrations we might bring our products to the life and make them stand out—
              adding extra details and personality.
            </dl>
            <dl>Another benefit of applying motion is capturing users attention and making users engage with your
              product. Animations are also one of the most effective ways to tell the story about your brand, product or
              services.</dl>
            <dt>MicroInteractions</dt>
            <dl>Microinteractions exist pretty much in every single app or website. You see them every time when you’re
              opening your favourite app —for instance Facebook has tons of different microinteractions and I assume
              that the “Like” feature is just the perfect example. Sometimes we are not even aware of existence, because
              they are so so obvious, natural and “blended” into user interfaces. Altough, If you remove them from your
              product you will notice very quickly that something really important is missing.</dl>
            <dl>Generally speaking, in UI/UX design sometimes even really small and subtle change might make huge
              impact. Microinteractions are the perfect proof that details and attention to them might greatly improve
              the overall user experience of your digital products and place them on the next/higher level. Every year,
              every new device brings new oppurtinitues for creating brand new and innovative microinteractions. 2020
              wouldn’t be exception for sure.</dl>

            <dt>3D Graphic in web & mobile UI</dt>
            <dl>3D graphic exist pretty much everywhere — in movies, video games, adverts on the streets. 3D graphic has
              been introduced few decades ago and since then has improved and evolved dramatically. Mobile and web
              technology is also growing rapidly fast. New web browser capabilities have opened the door for 3D graphic
              allowing us as designers to create and implement amazing 3D graphics into modern web and mobile
              interfaces.
            </dl>
            <dl>Creating and then integration of 3D graphic into web and mobile interfaces requires some specific skills
              and tons of work, but very often the results are very rewarding.
            </dl>

            <dl>3D graphic renders allows to present the product or services in the a lot more interactive and engaging
              way: for instance 3D graphic renders could be viewed in 360 degree presentation improving the overall UX
              of the product.</dl>
            <dl>In 2020 even more brands will use 3D render models to present the product or services in order to
              emulate the real world (in-store) shopping experience.</dl>
            <dt>Virtual Reality</dt>
            <dl>2019 has been a big year for VR. In the last years we have seen a lot of progress and excitement in VR
              headsets — mostly in gaming industry. We need to keep in mind that gaming industry very often brings
              innovation and new technologies into digital product design. Research proves that VR is no exception as
              after Oculus Quest in 2019 launch many opportunities have opened for other industries. Facebook CEO Mark
              Zuckerberg has already tested exciting hand interaction feature and officially announced hand-tracking
              update for Quest, coming early 2020!</dl>
            <dl>Sony and Microsoft will release their new generation consoles in 2020 holiday season. These would bring
              a lot opportunities and room to growth for VR technology.</dl>

            <dt>Augmented Reality</dt>
            <dl>In the last years we have seen a lot of progress, excitement and improvement of AR. The world’s leading
              tech companies are investing millions into AR development , so we should expect to expand and grow this
              technology in 2020. Even Apple has introduced their own AR toolkit called ARKIT 3 to help designers and
              developers build AR based products.
            </dl>
            <dl>There are endless opportunities to innovate and create brand new and exciting experiences in AR space.
              UI design for AR will be one of the major trends in 2020, so as designers we should be prepared and eager
              to learn new tools, principles when creating AR experiences.</dl>

            <dt>Neumorphism</dt>
            <dl>Generally speaking Skeuomorphic design refers to the design elements that are created in a realistic
              style/way to match the real life objects. The growth of VR/AR technology and latest design trends shown on
              the most popular design platforms (Dribbble, Behance etc.) might make skeuomorphic design comeback in 2020
              — but this time with a lot modern fashion and slightly modified name: “New skeuomorphism” (also called
              Neumorphism).</dl>
            <dl>As you’ve probably noticed: Neumorphism represents very detailed and precise design style. Highlight,
              shadows, glows — attention to details is very impressive and definitely on spot. Neumorphism has already
              inspired a lot of designers from all over the world and there is big chance that Neumorphism will be the
              biggest UI design trend in 2020.</dl>

            <dt>Asymmetrical Layouts</dt>
            <dl>
              In the last years we have noticed huge grown of asymmetrical layouts in digital product design.
              Traditional / “template” based layouts are definitely going away. 2020 will not be any different as this
              trend will continue. Proper usage of asymmetrical layouts add a lot of character, dynamic and personality
              to our designs, so they do not template based anymore.

            </dl>
            <dl>There is a lot of room for creativity as the number of options and opportunities when creating
              asymmetrical layouts are endless. Although, creating successful asymmetrical layouts requires some
              practice and time — placing elements randomly on the grid wouldn’t work :) also they should be used and
              implemented with care — always keeping in mind users needs : we do not want to get them lost when using
              our digital products — do we? :)</dl>

            <dt>Storytelling</dt>
            <dl>Stories play an very important role in overall UX in the digital product design. You might see them very
              often on the landing pages as introduction to the brand, product or new service. Storytelling is all about
              transferring data to the users in the best possible informative and creative way. This could be achieved
              by copyrighting mixed with strong and balanced visual hierarchy (typography, illustrations, high-quality
              photos, bold colours, animations and interactive elements).
            </dl>
            <dl>Storytelling really helps to create positive emotions and relationships between your brand and users.
              Storytelling might also make your brand a lot more memorable and making users feel like they are part of
              our products or services, so they would like to associate with them. Having said that, storytelling is
              also great and efficient marketing tool that might greatly increase the sales of your products/services.
              Storytelling as the very successful tool will continue and expand in 2020.</dl>

        <header>What Exactly Does A UI Designer Do?</header>
        <article>
          <h1></h1>
          <p>If you want your website, desktop or mobile app to be able to compete in today’s market, it’s got to be
            simple, intuitive and fun. Even if you have a super useful app, it’ll easily get lost in the sea of other
            ideas out there if it’s considered ugly or hard to use.</p>

          <li>Chris Mears from UXr gives the following advice:</li>

          <li>A funky interface is nothing more than a vanity project if your users can’t use it. User test regularly
            and don’t be afraid to simplify for usability.</li>

          <li>This is where your role as as UI designer comes in. You’re responsible for the look and feel of an
            application. It’s your job to ask:</li>

          <li>Do the colors work well together?</li>
          <li>How is typography used to convey meaning and hierarchy?</li>
          <li>Is the app well-designed? How can I improve the UI design of the app? Would flat UI design (sometimes
            called flat design) work here?</li>
          <li>And it’s these questions you’ll be responsible for answering.</li>

          <li>As a UI designer you’ll work very closely with UX designers, whose job typically consists of talking with
            customers to determine requirements, building user profiles and creating user stories to show how a user
            will work their way through your application.</li>


          <li>From this point, it’s up to you to build a clean and functional design based on the requirements they’ve
            gathered.</li>

          <li>Luke Chambers from UXMastery told us:</li>

          <li>UI designers have the responsibility of creating touchpoints that directly interface with users or
            customers. It is at the coalface of most online or app-driven businesses. Although there are clear
            differences between the two disciplines, let’s not forget there are some overlapping qualities between UX
            and UI Design. Here are a few, taken from UsabilityGeek’s article The Difference Between UX & UI Design.

          <p>Both UX & UI:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Have a primary objective of improving customer satisfaction</li>
            <li>Focus on the user and his/her interaction with a product/service</li>
            <li>Can be applied to any product</li>

        <article>
          <ul>
            <li> Learning to be a UI designer is not easy. Trust me, I’ve been there! There are specific skills and
              traits that will make your journey into this career go more smoothly and I’ve listed a few of them for you
              below. Take a look and see if this describes you:
            <li>

              You have drive!

            <li> The most important thing to succeed as a UI designer is attitude. If you don’t have a personal drive to
              learn and grow then you won’t get very far!
            <li>

              You enjoy learning!

            <li> Being a UI designer means staying up to date on the latest design trends and changes in the industry.
              Things change fast! If you don’t keep up it’s easy to fall behind and become less relevant.
            <li>

              You’re a team player!

            <li> UI designers often work as part of a team. This team could consist of other designers, programmers,
              marketers, salespeople, you name it! So it’s important to be comfortable working with others and
              communicating with colleagues of all levels. If you find it difficult to take constructive criticism, you
              might find you have trouble in this field.
            <li>

              You care about people!

            <li> User Interface design is all about people. After all, they’re the ones who will be using the interfaces
              you design! If you don’t care about their needs and wants, you won’t get very far in this industry. If
              you’re not sure what it means to be user-centered, read this!
            <li>

              As Steve Portigal, author of Interviewing Users, told me:

            <li>It’s incredibly important to be able to talk to people who might use your product – not just to get
              their critique of your solution, but before you even consider a solution. That’s when you can have the
              most open mind and learn about their current behavior and the motivations that drive that behavior.
            <li>

          <p>Self-Taught, Free Ways To Learn UI Design</p>
          <p>he internet has become an amazing resource for learning UI design online. And it’s certainly possible to
            teach yourself a new skill without spending a dime. However, if you’re looking to launch a career in User
            Interface design, you’ll most likely find gaps in your knowledge if you stick with an unstructured,
            self-taught program of learning. As a starter though, it’s a great way for getting a feel for the subject.
          </p>

          <p>YouTube - With billions of videos and viewers, YouTube had grown into a legitimate content platform.
            Searching for “UI Design” on YouTube will give you hundreds of thousands of results to choose from. With so
            many videos, it can be tough to separate the high quality content from the low quality.</p>

          <p>Blog Posts - Blog posts can be a great way to learn from others, especially if that blog is a targeted UI
            design blog. Like YouTube videos, there are a lot to choose from so finding the good ones can be
            challenging. I personally think that whether you’re a seasoned UI designer or just starting out, it’s
            important to always be reading content from other designers. It helps you stay on top of the best UI design
            techniques (as well as the most recent) and changes in the industry.</p>

          <p>Tutorial Sites - Tutorial sites can be super helpful in teaching you how to accomplish specific results in
            your designs. One drawback, however, is that UI design software changes so rapidly that User Interface
            design tutorials can quickly go out of date. That’s why I always recommend searching within the last year or
            two when looking for design tutorials or UI design tool tutorials.</p>


          <p>Books - OK, not entirely free, but books can be an inexpensive way of learning a great deal of information.
            It might seem old-fashioned to read books these days, but there has been a great deal written and published
            on UI design, especially in recent years. It’s also good to get a break from your computer screen from time
            to time.</p>

        <header>What Are The Steps You Should Take?</header>
        <article>
          <p>So once you’ve finished studying UI design, what do you do next if you want to become a UI designer? How
            the heck do you get a job without any work experience?</p>

          <p>Build A Great Portfolio</p>
          <p>You can have all the credentials and references in the world, but if you can’t show examples of great work,
            no one is going to want to talk to you about any potential job openings in UI design.</p>

          <p>We realize this here at CareerFoundry, so we focus heavily on making sure you have a well-rounded portfolio
            when you’ve completed your course.</p>

          <p>If you haven’t had a chance to develop a portfolio, then it’s time to get to work. Got an idea for an app
            or website? Design it! It doesn’t matter if it’s a real world project or not, it’s all about showing
            potential employers that you’ve got design chops.

            Get Work Experience
            If you need experience to be taken seriously by employers, how do you get an interview when you have no work
            experience? This is the question every new UI designer asks. The answer is actually really simple.

            Head over to UpWork, Freelancer, PeoplePerHour, or Guru, build a portfolio and start bidding on UI design
            jobs. At this stage, it isn’t about the money. It’s about proving that you know your stuff. So take any jobs
            you can. The aim of this exercise is to get good work experience and positive references. Within just a
            month or two you might have enough under your belt to spark the interest of potential employers. Either way
            your confidence will certainly grow as you gain more experience in the work and dealing with clients.

            You can even search for contract jobs on Craigslist. Head over to the Gigs Creative sections and see what’s
            there! You just might find something that turns into a lucrative contract.</p>

          <p>Build Your Network
            This part is absolutely huge. Your personal network will be extremely useful when you’re looking for your
            next gig.

            I had an extremely modest network when I started my first job as a UI designer. Since then, my personal
            network has grown substantially and it’s been crazy useful. If I was ever looking for a short term contact
            between jobs, or just looking for extra money, I’ve been able to call on my network to find work in as
            little as one week.

            Seriously, I can’t understate the power of a personal network.</p>

          <p>Here’s four quick tips on building your network:

            When you start your first job, be friendly and get to know your coworkers. Follow them on Facebook, Twitter,
            etc. You never know when that relationship will come in handy!
            Pimp your LinkedIn profile, fill out every detail of relevant experience and upload a well-shot photo of
            yourself.
            Don’t be afraid to approach experts in the field asking for advice. This could be the start of a very
            fruitful working relationship (for you both). Just be sure to always say thank you and to give something
            back.
            Attend events in your area, get to know other professionals in the field, remember names and give out your
            business card. Meeting people face-to-face is your best networking tool and will always beat an online
            ‘friend request’. Follow up these introductions in the following week.
            Build Your Personal Brand
            But what exactly is a personal brand? It’s what others see when they Google your name. It’s the color scheme
            you use on your Twitter and your website. It’s an emotion that’s evoked when someone sees your persona
            online.</p>

          <p>Your personal brand starts with your social network. Make sure they are all as consistent as possible. Use
            similar color schemes and themes to evoke similar emotions across different networks. The same goes for a
            personal website. Keep a similar voice and visual feel as your other social assets.</p>
